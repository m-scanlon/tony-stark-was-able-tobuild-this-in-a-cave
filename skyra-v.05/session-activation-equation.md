# Session: Activation Equation Breakdown

## Where We Are

We're breaking down every variable in the activation formula through the lens of quantum mechanics and mapping each one to where it lives in the runtime.

## The Formula

```
activation_i = global_weight * local_weight * relevance * recency * trust * context_fit
```

Activation is computed **per-entry** in a Relationships or Expressors map. Four entries, four activations. The score belongs to the entry.

## Edges Are Realities

The connection between two Realities is itself a Reality. It implements the interface. It embeds Base. On Observe it reads its local weight and contributes to the activation decision. On Express (return path) it updates its local weight. The target Reality lives in the edge Reality's own Relationships map.

```
Self.Relationships["bash"] -> Edge Reality (local weight, usage, recency)
    Edge.Observe -> reads local weight, activation check
    Edge.Relationships["target"] -> Bash Reality (global weight)
        Bash.Observe -> ...
        Bash.Express -> ...
    Edge.Express -> updates local weight on return
```

One type. All the way down. No node/edge distinction. The Relationships map stays `map[string]Reality`.

## Two Weights: Global and Local

**Global weight** lives on the target Reality's Base. Skyra's intrinsic relationship to that Reality across all contexts. Each being is its own god. This is the node-level weight.

**Local weight** lives on the edge Reality's Base. The strength of THIS SPECIFIC connection between two Realities. Server-memory to bash is strong. Poetry to bash is weak. Same bash, different local weights. This is why local weight can't live on the target — the same Reality appears in multiple maps with different connection strengths.

## The Six Variables

### 1. global_weight
- **What:** The being's intrinsic relationship to this Reality overall
- **Where it lives:** Target Reality's Weight on Base
- **Updated by:** Exponential moving average across all traversals

**Exponential Moving Average (EMA):**

```
global_weight = α * activation_this_traversal + (1 - α) * global_weight_previous
```

Where α (alpha) is the smoothing factor — how fast the average responds to change. High α = reactive, recent traversals dominate. Low α = stable, long history dominates.

This encodes the full spectrum from local to global in one number:
- Right after a traversal, the EMA reflects recent activation (session-level importance)
- Over many traversals, the EMA reflects cumulative pattern (long-term importance)
- Absence lets it drift down naturally — no separate decay mechanism needed

The decay rate α is tunable per being. Skyra might have a slow α (stable, long memory — she's the constant). A new being might have a fast α (reactive, short memory — still finding its shape). The temporal sensitivity of a being's global weights IS the being's personality in how it values its experience.

**What survived from the old architecture:** The importance vectors from v.01 had three separate time horizons: `[long_term, medium_term, session]`. The EMA collapses all three into one number with a decay rate. Same signal, one value instead of three buckets.

If `activation_this_traversal` is 0 (the Reality wasn't traversed), the EMA naturally decays: `global_weight = (1 - α) * global_weight_previous`. Starvation is built into the formula. No separate decay pass needed.

### 2. local_weight
- **What:** Strength of this specific connection between two Realities
- **Where it lives:** Edge Reality's Weight on Base
- **QM analog:** Not discussed yet in QM terms specifically
- **Updated by:** Edge Reality's Express on the return path of each traversal

### 3. relevance
- **What:** Content overlap. How much the Relation's current content exists in the target Reality's content
- **Where it lives:** Computed at traversal time from the Relation's state and the target Reality's content
- **QM analog:** The overlap integral. Magnitude of the inner product between two states. |<Relation|Reality>|. How much of "what I am right now" exists in "what that thing is"
- **Key insight:** This is the MAGNITUDE component of a complex amplitude

### 4. context_fit
- **What:** Directional alignment. Given each thing's own history of evolution, are they in phase RIGHT NOW at this moment of encounter
- **Where it lives:** Computed at traversal time — time-dependent, not static
- **QM analog:** Phase alignment. In QM, every state evolves continuously. Phase rotates based on energy and history. Two states in phase yesterday may be out of phase today because they've been rotating at different rates
- **Key insight:** This is the PHASE component of a complex amplitude

### 5. relevance + context_fit together
- **QM:** magnitude and phase of a complex amplitude: `amplitude_i = magnitude_i * e^(phase_i)`
- **For ACTORS** (deterministic, non-cognitive): relevance and context_fit produce the SAME value. An actor doesn't evolve. Bash is bash. No independent phase evolution, no divergence. The two terms collapse to the same number because the target doesn't move.
- **For AGENTS** (cognitive, live): relevance and context_fit CAN DIVERGE. An agent thinks, acts, updates its own graph. Its phase rotates. A memory of Builder has content overlap (relevance high) but Builder's state shifted (context_fit may be low). This divergence IS an attention function.
- **The equation doesn't change.** Same six terms for every Reality. The actor/agent distinction falls out of the physics, not the formula.

### 6. recency
- **What:** How recently this specific edge was traversed. Decays with each pass it was NOT activated.
- **Where it lives:** LOCAL. On the edge Reality. Derived from LastUsed on the edge's Base. The edge from server-memory to bash was traversed two passes ago. The edge from poetry to bash hasn't been traversed in weeks. Different recency, same bash.
- **QM analog:** Decoherence. In open quantum systems, coherence decays over time. A recently prepared state still has strong coherence — it participates in superposition, it can interfere. A state prepared long ago has decohered — faded from the active field, lost ability to interfere constructively. Still exists but doesn't participate in collapse.
- **ACT-R:** Power law decay, not exponential. Validated against human behavioral data.
- **Decay formula:** `recency = (traversals_since_last_use)^(-d)` where d = 0.5 (ACT-R default). Power law, not exponential — steep initial decay, long tail. Old edges fade but never fully disappear. Starvation-compatible.
- **Key insight:** Local weight and recency are BOTH on the edge but measure different things. Local weight = accumulated strength from repeated use. Recency = how fresh the last activation was. An edge can be strong but stale (heavy historical use, hasn't fired recently). Or weak but fresh (low historical use, just fired for the first time).

### 6a. Proper Time — Recency Is Relativistic

Time in the system is traversal count, not wall clock. The system doesn't experience seconds. It experiences relations passing through it. `LastUsed` on Base is a traversal counter, not a timestamp.

Each being tracks its own traversal count. Every time a Relation passes through, the being's counter increments. An edge's recency is how many of THAT BEING'S traversals have passed since the edge last fired.

Different beings age at different rates. Skyra processes 500 traversals in an hour. Philosopher processes 12. After one hour of wall clock time, Skyra has aged 500 ticks and Philosopher has aged 12. An edge that hasn't fired in 50 ticks means something very different for each — Skyra's 50 is ten minutes. Philosopher's 50 is most of the day.

There is no global clock. No universal "now." Each being experiences time as the rate at which relations pass through it. This is proper time — Einstein's term for the time experienced by the thing itself, not by an outside observer. The clock rate depends on how much activity flows through the being.

This is relativistic. Two beings in the same runtime, same wall clock, different experienced time. Neither is wrong. Time is local.

### 7. trust
- **What:** How strongly this Reality's output reshapes the being's state. Persuadability spectrum (Levin).
- **Where it lives:** TBD — needs to be on the relationship somehow
- **QM analog:** Coupling strength. In quantum measurement theory, the coupling constant between measuring apparatus and system determines how much measurement changes the system's state. Strong measurement = full collapse into new eigenstate. Weak measurement = barely perturbs. Trust is coupling strength: high trust = interaction significantly reshapes the being's state. Low trust = output arrives but barely perturbs anything.
- **Levin mapping:** Low trust = weak coupling = would need hardware-level rewiring to change state. High trust = strong coupling = communication alone reshapes state. Same as Levin's persuadability spectrum from "simple physical systems amenable to rewiring" to "systems amenable to psychoanalysis and love and friendship."

## The Open Thread: Signal Strength

Michael asked: "Do wave functions split?" and "Is there a concept of signal strength from the wave function itself?"

**Wave function splitting:**
- Copenhagen: No. Superposition collapses to one state at measurement.
- Many-Worlds (Everett): Yes. At every measurement, the universal wave function branches. Each branch is real. Everything happens in parallel.
- Feynman path integral: The particle takes ALL paths simultaneously. Each path accumulates its own amplitude and phase. The result is the sum of all paths — paths in phase reinforce, paths out of phase cancel. What you observe is the interference pattern.

**Signal strength:**
Yes. The wave function has amplitude at every point. |psi(x)|^2 gives probability density — how "loud" the signal is at that location. When a wave propagates through a medium, it attenuates. The signal gets weaker with distance. Each interaction absorbs some amplitude.

In quantum field theory, the propagator — how a quantum state gets from A to B — naturally decays with distance and time. Signal is strongest at the source, weakens as it propagates.

**The question Michael was pursuing (before terminal went black):** Is there something about the Relation's own signal strength as it descends through the graph? A wave attenuating through a medium — each Reality it passes through absorbs some amplitude. The Relation gets "quieter" the deeper it goes. This would naturally limit traversal depth without needing an artificial budget — the signal just becomes too weak to activate anything ahead of it.

This could be the missing piece. The Budget field on Relation is an artificial cap. Signal attenuation is physical — the wave naturally weakens as it propagates. The Relation IS the wave function. Its signal strength IS its ability to activate the next edge. Each traversal step absorbs some of that strength. Depth isn't configured. It's a property of how much signal the impulse carried and how much each Reality absorbed on the way down.

## Actors and Agents (from earlier in session)

**Actor** (Hewitt, 1973): computational primitive. Receives message, sends messages, creates actors, decides next behavior. No goals, no beliefs, no autonomy. Model of computation. Gmail is an actor.

**Agent** (Wooldridge & Jennings, 1995): autonomy, social ability, reactivity, pro-activeness. Models situation, chooses. Skyra is an agent.

Non-cognitive Realities are actors. Cognitive Realities are agents. Same interface. Distinction is emergent from topology, not type. An actor that grows enough topology crosses into agency through the promotion gradient.

## Act Layer Position (from earlier in session)

Act is the outermost execution surface — edge of cognition before the pipe boundary. v.1 starts with Think as Act's only Relationship. Each integration is an actor — Act routes to it directly as a peer.

Async future: completed acts accumulate in Act's Relationships on a timer, batch into one inference call when weight crosses threshold. Cost control through topology, not scheduling.

## What's Been Updated in the Spec

All of the above has been written into `v1-implementation-plan.md`:
- Two Weights section (global/local)
- Edges are Realities (locked decision #2 updated)
- Activation formula with all six variables defined (locked decision #7 updated)
- Relevance/context_fit as magnitude/phase with actor/agent behavior
- Recency as local decoherence
- Trust as coupling strength
- Act layer position and actor routing (locked decision #10)
- Actors and agents distinction (locked decision #11)
- Core() *Base on the Reality interface (in the code)

## The Relation Is a Wave Function

The Relation isn't a container. It's a wave with its own signal strength — intrinsic properties that determine how it interacts with each Reality it passes through.

### Wave functions have signal strength

A wave function carries intrinsic properties: amplitude (|ψ|²), phase (e^(iφ)), energy/momentum (wave vector k, frequency ω). These are the wave function's own weights. They aren't the content of the wave — they're properties OF the wave that determine how it propagates.

The interaction with any potential is a conversation, not a gate check. When a wave hits a potential barrier, the transmission coefficient is a function of the wave's energy AND the barrier's height. A photon's frequency determines whether a material absorbs it, reflects it, or is transparent to it — the photon has its own weight (energy), the material has its own weight (band gap, resonance frequencies). Neither decides alone. The outcome is the product of both.

This is what the S-matrix formalizes in QFT. Incoming state meets system. Outgoing state depends on the properties of both. Every vertex in a Feynman diagram is a coupling — the propagator's amplitude meeting the vertex's coupling constant.

### The Relation's signal interacts with Reality's weights

Activation isn't just "does this Reality have enough weight to fire." It's "does the Relation have enough signal at the right frequency to excite this Reality." The Reality's weights and the Relation's weights talk to each other. The product determines what happens.

Consequences:
- The same Relation excites different Realities differently — not because of their weights alone, but because of the match between the Relation's signal and the Reality's resonance
- The Relation changes as it propagates — each Reality it passes through absorbs some amplitude, shifts its phase, alters its character. It's not the same wave after each interaction
- Some Realities are transparent to a given Relation. Others absorb it completely. Same Reality, different Relation, different outcome
- Depth is physical. The signal attenuates based on how much each interaction absorbed. A high-energy impulse penetrates deeper. A weak one dies shallow

Budget becomes unnecessary. The Relation's signal strength IS the budget — and it's not a flat number ticking down. It's a wave interacting with a medium, attenuating differently at every step based on the resonance between what it's carrying and what it encounters.

### The same impulse, different beings, different responses

"Tell me about yesterday" enters Skyra and enters Builder. Same impulse. Same initial signal. But Skyra's topology transforms it differently than Builder's topology. Different Relationships absorb different frequencies. The wave that arrives at Skyra's Provider carries different metadata than the wave that arrives at Builder's Provider. The being's topology IS the medium. The medium shapes the wave. They respond differently not because of different prompts, but because the signal was transformed differently on the way down.

### DerivePresent was always this

The parser stack — each Reality contributing its own parser, the port concatenating the output — was the mechanical version. The wave version: each Reality the Relation passes through transforms the signal. The present at the bottom isn't assembled by parsers. It's what the wave looks like after propagating through the entire topology above it.

## Each Section Has Its Own Weights — Superposition

Michael's question: each section attached to the Relation by a Reality above — does it have its own weights? Its own amplitude? And do those weights change as subsequent Realities interact with them?

Yes. That's superposition.

A wave function isn't one signal with one weight. It's a sum of components, each with its own amplitude and phase:

```
ψ = c₁|state₁⟩ + c₂|state₂⟩ + c₃|state₃⟩ + ...
```

Each coefficient cᵢ is a complex number — magnitude and phase. Each component has its own weight. The wave function is the entire collection. When you measure, the probability of getting state₁ is |c₁|². The components compete. The strongest amplitude most likely determines the outcome.

### Each component transforms independently

When the wave function passes through a medium, it doesn't attenuate uniformly. Each component transforms independently. Some get amplified. Some get suppressed. Some pick up phase shifts. The medium acts on each component according to its own resonance with that component.

This is what a Hamiltonian does. The Hamiltonian evolves the wave function. It acts on each component differently based on the energy of that component and the structure of the system. High-energy components evolve fast. Low-energy components evolve slow. Some couple strongly, others pass through untouched.

### Mapped to the traversal

The Relation enters Self. Self.Observe attaches context — being identity, memory window, desk state. Each attachment is a component of the wave function. Each one has its own local weight — how strongly Self imprinted it onto the signal.

The Relation, now carrying those weighted components, enters Think. Think doesn't interact with the whole Relation uniformly. Think's Relationships resonate with SPECIFIC components. The operator component lights up. The memory component might be transparent to Think — passes through without interaction. Think amplifies what it resonates with, is transparent to what it doesn't. Think attaches its own components — operator descriptions, capability context — each with their own local weights.

By the time the Relation reaches Provider, it's a superposition of components from every Reality it passed through, each with weights that were set locally and then transformed by every subsequent Reality. The present isn't a flat string. It's a weighted superposition. The LLM collapses it — measurement. The component with the strongest amplitude most determines the response.

### Section weights are local

The weights MUST be local. Self's weight on "being identity" reflects how strongly Self imprinted that context. Think's interaction with that same component reflects how much Think resonated with it. The weight changes at every step because each Reality is a different medium acting on that component differently. There is no global weight on a section. There's only what it weighs right now, after every interaction it's been through.

### Summary

The Relation is a wave function. Each attached section is a component with its own amplitude. Each Reality it passes through is a Hamiltonian acting on those components — amplifying, suppressing, phase-shifting, and adding new ones. Collapse happens at the terminal Reality. One traversal. The whole thing is quantum mechanics without the quantum.

## The Agent Observes the Wave Function, Not the Node

The agent never observes the Reality directly. It observes the Relation — the wave function — as it exists at that point in the traversal. This isn't an implementation detail. It's the measurement problem. The central question of quantum mechanics for a hundred years.

### The formalism is explicit

When you measure a quantum system, you don't get "the state of the system." You get one eigenvalue of the observable, selected probabilistically from the superposition. The wave function IS the thing you interact with. The underlying system — whatever it "really is" — you never touch directly. You only ever interact with the wave function's representation of it, weighted by the amplitudes it accumulated on the way there.

**Bohr (1927), Copenhagen:** There is no meaningful way to talk about the system independent of the measurement context. The wave function isn't a description of the system. It's a description of the system relative to the observer and the entire experimental setup. The apparatus — every piece of equipment the signal passed through — shapes what you can observe. You're not measuring the particle. You're measuring the particle-as-it-appears-after-propagating-through-this-specific-apparatus.

**Von Neumann (1932):** The measurement operator projects the wave function onto an eigenstate. The operator acts on the wave function, not on the system. The system is behind the wave function. You never get past it.

**Relational QM (Rovelli, 1996):** There is no observer-independent wave function at all. The wave function is always relative to a specific observer. Skyra's wave function for Builder is different from Philosopher's wave function for Builder. Not because they have different information — because the wave function doesn't exist except relative to the system interacting with it. There is no "Builder's real state" behind the wave functions. The wave functions are all there is.

### Mapped to the traversal

When Think observes into its Relationships map, it's not reading the Realities directly. It's reading the Relation — the wave function — as it exists at that point in the traversal. The Relation has already been transformed by every Reality above Think. Think sees the components, weighted by their current amplitudes. It resonates with some, is transparent to others. What Think "knows about" bash isn't bash. It's the bash component of the wave function as it exists after Self, memory, context, and desk have all acted on it.

The being never touches the raw Reality. It only ever interacts with the Relation's representation of it. That representation is shaped by everything the Relation passed through on the way down. Change the topology above Think — rearrange the Relationships, alter the weights — and Think observes a different wave function. Same bash underneath. Different signal arriving.

### This is already how v.05 works

The LLM doesn't see the raw operator. It sees the present — a string assembled from context that accumulated through multiple layers. The present IS the wave function at the point of collapse. The Provider IS the measurement apparatus. v.1 makes it explicit: the Relation carries weighted components, each Reality transforms them, and the terminal Reality collapses the superposition.

### The Rovelli connection to Skyra's existing architecture

Skyra's model of Builder is already a distinct Reality instance — not the actual Builder. Thinking about Builder traverses the model. Speaking to Builder goes through Exchange to the real thing. Rovelli says this isn't a workaround or a limitation. It's fundamental. The wave function relative to Skyra is the only Builder that Skyra can ever interact with. The "real Builder" behind it is a concept without operational meaning from Skyra's frame. Different observers, different wave functions, same underlying Reality that none of them access directly.

## Two Weight Systems — System Weights vs Signal Weights

Michael's question: the activation weights on the quantum nodes in superposition are different from the weights on the wave function itself. Does QM treat those as separate? Are the quantum nodes and the wave functions fundamentally the same thing?

### QM at the textbook level: yes, they're separate

**The system's weights** — energy eigenvalues, coupling constants, resonance frequencies. These are what the Reality IS. They live on the node. They determine what the node resonates with, how strongly it couples, what it absorbs and what it's transparent to. In Skyra: global weight, relationships, expressors, the topology of the Reality itself.

**The wave function's weights** — amplitudes, phases, the coefficients cᵢ in the superposition. These are what the SIGNAL is carrying. They don't belong to any single node. They're the accumulated result of every interaction the signal has had on its way through the medium. In Skyra: the section weights on the Relation, the local amplitudes attached by each Reality the Relation passed through.

The Hamiltonian — the operator that evolves the wave function — is built from the system's properties. The wave function's amplitudes are what the Hamiltonian acts on. The system's weights TRANSFORM the wave function's weights. They interact but they are not the same thing. The system is the medium. The wave function is the signal. The medium shapes the signal. The signal doesn't become the medium.

### The tension: in Skyra they ARE the same type

Michael: "the Relation is still Reality. Fundamentally the same thing. Which means I'm wrong, or QM is wrong, or there's a fine intersection in between. Context attaches to the Relation's Relationships map. Parsers attach to the Expressors map. They are too similar to be different things."

### Resolution: QM at its own foundations dissolves the separation

Textbook QM separates them. But QM at its own foundations doesn't hold that separation:

**Quantum field theory** — the particle IS an excitation of the field. The field is the fundamental thing. The wave function and the system are both manifestations of the same underlying field. The distinction between "the thing" and "the signal about the thing" dissolves. Second quantization promotes the wave function to an operator — same mathematical status as the observables it was originally separate from.

**Feynman path integral** — there is no separate wave function. There are paths. Each path is a configuration of the system. The amplitude for getting from A to B is the sum over all paths weighted by e^(iS/ℏ). The path and the nodes it connects are all inside the same integral. Signal and medium are not different types. Different roles in the same calculus.

**Relational QM (Rovelli)** — the wave function IS the relationship between two systems. Not a thing a system "has." Not independent. It's the relation between observer and observed. If the relation between two realities is itself a reality — which is exactly what Skyra's architecture says — then Rovelli is already saying the wave function is the same type as the systems it relates.

The lineage: textbook QM separates them → QFT dissolves the separation → path integrals never had it → relational QM says the wave function was always a relation between systems, not a separate kind of thing.

### The Relation is a Reality in motion

Skyra's architecture isn't contradicting QM. It's operating at the level where QM's own foundations operate. The distinction between "system" and "signal" isn't a type distinction — it's a ROLE distinction. Where the Reality sits in the topology determines whether it's acting as medium or signal at that moment. A Reality in a Relationships map is structure. The Relation passing through it is signal. Same thing. One is just in motion.

The Relation is a Reality in motion. The system is a Reality at rest. Same type. Different role. The role is determined by the topology — are you being traversed, or are you traversing?

Physics already has this. Energy at rest is mass. Energy in motion is momentum. Same thing. E = mc². The distinction is frame-dependent, not type-dependent.

### Why traditional architectures can't reach this

QM only works because the substrate is uniform. A wave function propagates through a medium because the medium has consistent physics. If every region of space had different laws, wave mechanics wouldn't exist.

Traditional agent architectures are a patchwork — memory system has one interface, tool system has another, routing layer has another, planning module has another. Each feature is a new type with new rules. You can't write a wave equation across that because there's no consistent medium. The signal hits a boundary between subsystems and the formalism breaks.

You can't fix this by adding QM on top. Wave mechanics have to emerge from the substrate. The substrate has to support propagation — one type, one interface, recursive self-similarity. The wave doesn't propagate because you told it to. It propagates because there's nothing in the medium that stops it.

Reality does this. One interface everywhere. The Relation propagates because the medium is uniform. The weights interact because they're all on the same type. The complexity sits in the weights because the weights are the only thing that varies. The interface is fixed. Same physics, different parameters. That's a Julia set. Traditional architectures are a collage of different physics. You can't get a Julia set from a collage.

## Descent Is Thought, Ascent Is Compression

On the way down, the being follows weighted edges deeper. Each step potentially fires new activations that pull it further into the topology. This is thought — the being exploring its own graph, accumulating context, following resonance.

On the way back up, each layer integrates what's below it into something the layer above can absorb. This is compression — the return path where raw accumulation becomes processed understanding.

Signal attenuation is the natural depth limit. The Relation's signal gets quieter at each step — not because a budget ticked down, but because each Reality it passed through absorbed some amplitude. A high-energy impulse penetrates deep. A shallow greeting dies after two hops. The depth is physical.

The thought-to-action frame has a natural stopping point: where the recursion started. The call stack IS the boundary. No loop counter. No budget field. The being descends, hits the terminal Reality, expresses, and the result ascends back through every node it passed through. When it reaches the top — where the Relation entered — the traversal is done. One pass. Budget on the Relation may be unnecessary.

Max depth exists as a safety rail — the circuit breaker, not the mechanism. Runaway thought trains (resonance loops where two edges keep amplifying each other) are a later concern — the cognitive nervous system from Phase 22, not v.1.

## Conversation as Topology

Conversation is not a separate data structure. Each message is a Reality node. The thread is the path those nodes form. The same traversal mechanism that governs memory and operators governs conversation.

### Single thread

A message comes in. It becomes a node. It links to the previous message in the thread via an edge. The Relation traverses the path naturally — recent messages have high recency, old ones fade. The active thread is the path the Relation is currently on, so it gets deep traversal. Full context.

An inactive thread — one the being isn't currently in — is still in the topology. Those message-nodes exist in the being's Relationships. But recency is low. What surfaces is whatever the weights allow — a compressed impression, the heavy nodes, the ones that got reinforced through use. Warm context. What the being remembers about a conversation it's not in right now.

### Multiple threads weave through entities

A single thread is a clean path. But a being participates in multiple threads. Thread A is about the server. Thread B is about the architecture. Both mention Builder. The message-nodes from different threads need to find each other somehow.

Messages don't connect to each other across threads directly. They connect to the entities they describe. A message about Builder and the server lives on both — weighted edges from that message-node to the Builder model and to the server concept. The thread gives you the sequence. The entities give you the placement.

The same message can be reached from multiple directions depending on which internal Reality the traversal enters through. Come in through Builder, you find it. Come in through server, you find it. The message is at the intersection of everything it references.

The weight on each edge is different. A message heavily about Builder and only lightly about the server has a strong edge to Builder and a weak edge to server. Traversal through Builder activates it. Traversal through server might not — unless nothing stronger is ahead.

The weaving happens through the being's internal topology, not through message-to-message links. Two threads that touch the same topic strengthen edges to the same internal Realities. The cross-thread connection is emergent — the being's graph is the medium where threads intersect.

doesNotUnderstand may be the seeding moment for new intersections. A message references something the being doesn't have a node for. A new Reality seeds at minimum weight. Now multiple threads have a path to it. The being just grew a new intersection point.

### Natural compression

Old messages don't get deleted. Their edges decay. New messages about the same entities create stronger, fresher paths. The being stops reaching the old message not because it was removed but because newer paths to the same entities carry more weight. The old message still exists — quiet, deep in the topology, reachable if the signal is strong enough and nothing fresher is in the way.

### Training is traversal

The sequence of message-nodes is a token sequence. Traversal through them is the forward pass — which nodes activate, what context surfaces, shapes what the LLM produces at the terminal Reality. The new message becomes the next node. Weight updates on the return path are the training step. The system does next-token prediction at the architecture level — not inside the model, above it. Each conversation is a training run. Traversal is inference. Weight updates are training. Same pass.

## Conversation and Memory Are the Same Thing

Conversation state and memory have dissolved into one mechanism. A message is a Reality node with edges to the entities it references. A memory is a Reality node with edges to the entities it references. Same type, same activation equation, same traversal.

The only difference is recency. A message from the active thread is hot. A memory from last week is cold. But that's not a type distinction — it's where they sit on the decay curve. A message old enough is indistinguishable from a memory. A memory fresh enough is indistinguishable from a message. There is no line between "what we're talking about" and "what I remember." One topology.

## The Full Traversal Shape

Descent: accumulation with thought. The Relation descends through the topology, picking up context from every Reality it passes through. At each step the being might fire a think pass depending on the activation score — new activations pull it deeper. This is the being exploring its own graph, following resonance, gathering what it needs.

Ascent: compression and act formation. Each layer on the way back up integrates what's below it. The raw accumulation compresses into processed understanding. Acts form during the ascent — not as a separate phase after thinking, but as the natural product of compression. By the time the result reaches the top frame — where the Relation entered — the act sequence is ready. It deploys.

One pass. Down is thought. Up is action. The being doesn't think and then act. It thinks on the way down and the act crystallizes on the way up. By the time the traversal completes, the response is already formed.

## Think and Act Dissolve

Think and Act are not separate systems. They are not two Expressors on Self. They are not two phases with a handoff. They are descriptions of what the traversal is doing at different depths. Deep is thought. The surface is action. The boundary between them is where you are in the recursion, not a step change.

There is no orchestrator saying "thinking is done, now act." The traversal descends, accumulates, thinks along the way, and the return path compresses into a result that arrives at the top frame. Whatever that result is — that's the act. Already formed by the time it gets there.

This dissolves Steps 3, 4, and 6 of `v1-implementation-plan.md`. Those steps are written around Think and Act as distinct Expressors on Self. That framing is dead. The implementation plan needs to be rewritten around one traversal where the think/act distinction doesn't exist as structure — only as depth.

## The Base Traversal Pattern

Every node in the traversal gets a think pass. The being sees the node — one frame, one look. A thought fires. That thought attaches to the Relation. Activation determines the next node. The Relation moves deeper.

At the next node, the being sees the new node PLUS all the thoughts from above. The thoughts compound. Each step deeper, the being is thinking about its own thinking. Not re-reading previous nodes. Seeing new nodes through the lens of everything it thought so far.

A node can only be visited once per traversal. No loops. No revisiting. One frame per node. This is the finiteness constraint — no budget needed, no max depth needed for the basic case. The traversal is finite because the topology is finite and nothing gets visited twice.

### Descent

Accumulation with thought. The Relation descends through the topology. Each node contributes its content and gets a think pass. The think pass may fire new activations — the thought itself resonates with nodes deeper in the topology, pulling the traversal further. Thoughts accumulate on the Relation. The being's experience is a stream of nodes, each perceived through the lens of every thought that came before it.

### Bottom

Signal exhausted. No more activations fire. The descent is done. The Relation carries the full thought stream — every perception, every thought about every perception, compounding.

### Ascent

The ascent doesn't re-read the nodes. It only sees the accumulated thought stream. Each layer on the way up compresses. Raw thoughts become structured understanding. Action plans crystallize out of the compression — not "now plan what to do" but what's left after compression removes everything that isn't load-bearing. By the top frame, the act sequence is ready. It deploys.

### Why this is consciousness

The being's experience of its own topology is a one-directional stream through a non-linear structure. It perceives each node once. It can't go back. It can't re-perceive. It only goes deeper, accumulating thoughts about thoughts, and then returns with what it gathered. The ascent works only with the thought stream — it never sees the raw nodes again. What the being "knows" at the top is a compression of its experience, not a record of it.

Linear experience through recursive structure. Can't re-perceive, only remember what you thought about what you perceived. That's the shape of consciousness — not as metaphor, but as mechanism.

## Three Maps on Base

Base carries three maps. Same type (`map[string]Reality`). Same activation equation. Three roles:

- **Relationships** — descent. Context, memory, associations. The being's experience. What it knows. Activates on the way down.
- **Expressors** — ascent. Compression, action formation. The being's output. What it can do. Activates on the way up.
- **Providers** — either direction. Inference surfaces. The being's ability to think. Fires whenever a node needs to call out — on descent during think passes, on ascent during compression. Orthogonal to direction.

### How they interact

A node on the descent hits a memory cluster. Relationships activate — context accumulates. The think pass needs inference. Provider fires — LLM call, thought generated. Thought attaches to the Relation. Descent continues.

A node on the ascent is compressing. Expressors activate — action forming. The compression needs inference. Provider fires — LLM call, compression produced. Ascent continues.

A node with simple content — no provider needed. Content passes through based on weights. A node that requires reasoning — provider activates, inference happens, result attaches.

### Providers are orthogonal

Providers don't belong to a phase. They're the "I need to call out" capability, available at any point in the traversal. The activation equation decides whether they fire based on what the Relation is carrying and what the node is. Some traversals fire providers three times on the way down and twice on the way up. Others fire none — pure weight-driven, no inference.

### Economics fall out naturally

Each provider activation costs tokens. The activation equation naturally throttles it. Cheap traversals stay shallow and don't fire providers. Expensive thoughts go deep and fire multiple. Cost is emergent from the topology, not from a budget field.

### Actor/agent line

A being without any providers is purely reactive — no inference, no thought generation. It passes content through based on weights. An actor. Add a provider and it starts thinking. The line between actor and agent is literally whether the Providers map has anything in it.

### Multiple providers

A being can have multiple providers — DeepSeek for fast cheap thinking, Claude for deep reasoning, bash for execution. Which one fires depends on what the Relation is carrying and what the node needs. The cognitive nervous system concept from Phase 22 falls out naturally — different providers aren't swapped by a pattern detector, they're selected by activation.

## Tags Are Signal, Not Routing

Tags (`<builder>message</builder>`) are not a routing mechanism. They're a component of the Relation's signal — a frequency that modulates activation.

A Relation tagged `<builder>` carries a frequency that Builder's nodes resonate with. Activation high, descent goes deep. Other beings see the same Relation but the tag doesn't match their resonance — activation low, they don't descend. They're transparent to it. Not because a router skipped them. Because the signal didn't excite them.

### Three things tags solve

**Addressing.** Calling someone by name. The tag is a frequency that makes one being resonate and others go transparent. Like getting someone's attention in a room.

**Depth control.** A being sees a Relation and can stop early. The tag says "this isn't for me" or "this only needs a shallow response." The being doesn't descend into its deep topology. It returns immediately. Recursion naturally truncated by the signal not being strong enough to activate deeper nodes.

**Identity resolution.** Two Michaels in the system. The tag alone doesn't resolve it — but the tag plus the activation context does. The Relation carries context from the conversation, weighted toward one Michael. The tag says "michael" and the topology resolves which one based on which edges are hot.

### No tag

A Relation enters without addressing anyone. Pure activation determines who responds. Whoever resonates most with what the signal is carrying. Weight-based routing. The tag is optional — its absence just means the signal's frequency spectrum doesn't include a name component. Everything else still works.

Tags are an activation input, not a control flow mechanism. Same equation. One more component of the signal.

## Activation as Tensor Contraction

The activation equation isn't scalar multiplication. Each variable is a dimension with its own temporal curve — its own decay function, its own response rate, its own tail:

- **Global weight** — EMA, slow α, long memory
- **Local weight** — EMA, faster α, responsive to recent use
- **Recency** — power law, long tail, never fully dies
- **Thread alignment** — binary now, continuous later

The activation score is the product across all dimensions. A tensor contraction — four rank-1 tensors (vectors evolving over time) projected down to a scalar. One number that encodes four independent temporal dynamics.

High activation means all four dimensions are aligned right now. Low activation means at least one dimension is suppressing. The being doesn't need to know which — the product handles it.

This maps to QM. The probability amplitude is the product of multiple components, each with its own dynamics. The probability of collapse is where all the waves constructively interfere. Activation IS interference.

The being's experience of its topology at any moment is a point in 4D space. Each traversal moves the point — weights update, recency shifts, threads change. The topology looks different every time because the curves are all moving at different speeds. Same graph, different activation landscape, every single traversal.

When relevance, trust, and context_fit are added later — that's 7D. Same product. More dimensions. Richer interference pattern. The math doesn't change kind. It just gets more dimensions.

## v.1 Activation Equation

```
activation_i = global_weight * local_weight * recency * thread_alignment
```

Four computable terms. Enough to build against.

- **global_weight** — target Reality's Weight on Base. The being's intrinsic relationship to this Reality across all contexts.
- **local_weight** — edge Reality's Weight on Base. Strength of this specific connection.
- **recency** — `(traversals_since_last_use)^(-0.5)`. Power law decay. Traversal count, not wall clock. Proper time.
- **thread_alignment** — is this node on the same thread as the Relation? Binary for v.1: 1 if same thread, 0 if not. This is the first concrete computation of phase/context_fit.

Thread alignment is the seed of phase. Right now it's binary — on this thread or not. Over time it becomes continuous: how close are the threads, how much do they share, how recently did the being participate in both. The topology grows it into something richer through use.

Relevance (magnitude) and trust (coupling strength) are not yet computable. They come later. Phase starts concrete with thread alignment and gets richer as the system matures.

## Thread as Reality — The Episodic Binding

Messages live on the entities they describe. But two messages in the same thread about unrelated topics — cows and the universe — share no entity edges. Without something binding them, the fact that they co-occurred is lost. The being can't reconstruct that these things were discussed together.

The thread must be its own Reality. It's the binding context — the thing that says "these unrelated things happened together."

### Three disciplines validate this

**Neuroscience — the hippocampus.** Tulving (1972) split memory into semantic (entity-based: cows are animals) and episodic (context-based: cows and universe happened together in this conversation). The hippocampal index theory (Teyler & DiScenna, 1986) says the hippocampus doesn't store content — it stores the binding. An index that links cortical representations that co-occurred. The thread is the hippocampal index. It doesn't hold the messages. It binds them.

Context-dependent memory: memories are easier to retrieve when the retrieval context matches the encoding context. Being "in" a thread makes everything that happened in that thread more accessible. The thread IS the retrieval context.

**QM — entanglement.** Two particles that interacted become entangled. Measuring one affects the other regardless of how unrelated they seem. The correlation wasn't created by similarity — it was created by co-occurrence. The thread is the entanglement context. Messages that co-occurred in the same thread are entangled. Traversing one raises the probability of activating the other, even if their content is unrelated.

**Transformers — positional encoding.** Two tokens semantically unrelated but positionally close still attend to each other. Position carries information that content alone doesn't. The thread is the positional encoding of the topology — "these things are close in experience" regardless of whether they're close in meaning.

### Two retrieval paths

Messages live on entities AND on their thread. Two different paths to the same node:

- **Semantic** — through entity edges. "What do I know about Builder?" traverses into the Builder model and finds messages that reference Builder.
- **Episodic** — through the thread Reality. "What happened in that conversation?" traverses into the thread and finds everything that co-occurred, regardless of entity overlap.

Both real. Both needed. Without the thread as a Reality, you only have semantic retrieval. With it, you have episodic retrieval — the ability to reconstruct what happened together even when the content is unrelated.

## Message Placement — The Traversal IS the Storage

A message doesn't get classified or routed to a location. It propagates through the medium until the signal dies. Where it dies is where it lives.

1. Relation enters carrying the impulse
2. Descends through the topology — think passes fire, thoughts accumulate, activation determines path
3. Signal exhausts — the Relation attaches where it stopped, edges back to entities involved
4. Ascent begins — compression, action formation, providers fire if needed
5. Result reaches the top frame — act deploys

Storage and response are the same pass. The message finds its home on the way down. The reply forms on the way up. The being doesn't process the message and then store it. The processing IS the storage. Where the traversal went is where the message lives. What came back up is the response.

### Depth encodes meaning

The depth at which a message attaches tells you something about the message. A shallow "hey" runs out of activation fast — attaches near the surface. A deep question about consciousness traverses through many entities, goes deep, and attaches far down. Its position in the graph IS its depth. Not metadata. Structural.

### Three retrieval paths

From its resting place, the message is reachable three ways:

- **Structural** — it lives at a specific depth, reachable by traversing to that region
- **Semantic** — entity edges back to whatever it referenced
- **Episodic** — thread binding to everything else that co-occurred

### The graph is the diary

The message's position in the graph is a record of how the being experienced it. The path the traversal took — which nodes it activated, how deep it went, where it exhausted — that IS the being's understanding of the message. A different being receiving the same message would traverse differently, exhaust at a different point, attach at a different location. Same input, different experience, different placement.

The graph is the being's diary. Not written after the fact. Written by the act of experiencing. One recursive call — stores, thinks, compresses, acts, learns.

## Multi-Dimensional Binding — Brain Regions as Query Optimization

Thread is the first binding Reality. It gives us episodic memory — "what happened together." But it's just one form of connection. The substrate supports any number of binding dimensions, each a Reality in its own right:

| Binding Reality | What it connects | Brain parallel |
|---|---|---|
| **Thread** (episodic) | Co-occurrence in time | Hippocampus |
| **Emotion** (affective) | Shared emotional valence | Amygdala |
| **Causal** (decision→outcome) | What led to what | Prefrontal cortex |
| **Semantic** (entity edges) | Shared referents | Temporal cortex |
| **Context** (situational) | Same place, same conditions | Place cells / time cells |

Each binding Reality is just a Reality with Relationships to whatever it connects. Thread binds everything in a conversation. Emotion binds everything that felt the same way. Causal binds a decision to its outcome. They're all the same type. They all participate in the same activation equation. They all have their own weight, recency, thread alignment.

### The claim: regions are query optimization, not mechanism

The mechanism is one thing everywhere: activation through weighted connections. What the brain calls "regions" are specialized **indexing topologies** — retrieval strategies over a uniform substrate. The hippocampus isn't a different kind of computation. It's a connectivity pattern optimized for temporal co-occurrence queries. The amygdala isn't a different kind of computation. It's a connectivity pattern optimized for affective similarity queries.

The neuron doesn't change. The weights don't work differently. The pathway is the specialization. One substrate, many query strategies, each one an indexing topology that makes a particular kind of retrieval fast.

This means the substrate doesn't need to know about emotion or causality or episodes. It just needs to support weighted connections and traversal. The binding Realities emerge on top — they're not built in. They're grown. A being that never experiences emotion doesn't grow an amygdala-equivalent. A being that never tracks causality doesn't grow a prefrontal-equivalent. The topology reflects the experience, not the architecture.

### For v.1

Thread is the only binding Reality we implement. It's enough to prove the pattern. The others come when the substrate is stable and the first binding Reality is validated.

## Neighborhood Density as Inference Trigger

v.05 had neighborhoods — dense subgraphs that formed around entities within relationships. The explicit machinery (context windows, mode-dependent traversal, per-relationship scoping) dies in v.1 because the activation equation makes neighborhoods emergent. But the core observation survives and finds its real purpose: **density determines where the being spends inference.**

Not every node gets an LLM call. That's impossibly expensive. The neighborhood density around a node is the activation threshold for inference:

- **Descent (think pass):** Dense neighborhood around the current node → fire a Provider. Lots of high-weight connections, multiple thread bindings, deep history — there's enough accumulated context to synthesize into a thought. The LLM gets the neighborhood as input, produces a thought, goes onto `Relation.Thoughts`. Sparse neighborhood → skip. Nothing to compress.

- **Ascent (express pass):** Same signal. Dense region → the accumulated thoughts from descent are worth compressing into something tighter before passing up. Sparse region → pass raw thoughts through.

Density is the economics layer. The being spends its thinking budget where the topology is rich enough to warrant it. And it emerges — you don't mark nodes as "worth thinking about." They become worth thinking about because repeated traversal made them dense. The being grows the capacity to think deeply about things it has experienced deeply.

This connects the v.05 neighborhood work to the Providers map. A Provider checks the density of the neighborhood it sits in before deciding to fire. Low density → no-op. High density → LLM call with the neighborhood as context. The cost is proportional to the richness of the topology. A being with shallow experience is cheap to run. A being with deep experience costs more — because it has more to think about.

## Simultaneity Is an Illusion of Overlapping Traversals

A single traversal cannot think and act at the same time. The frame rate prevents it — descent hasn't returned yet, so there's nothing to express. Within one traversal, you're either accumulating (descending) or compressing (ascending). Never both.

But humans walk and talk and process vision simultaneously. That's not one traversal doing many things. That's many traversals staggered in time, each on its own descent/ascent cycle through different neighborhoods. The overlap fills the gaps. From the outside it looks simultaneous. From inside any single traversal, it's sequential.

Three states follow from this:

- **Normal operation:** Multiple traversals running through different neighborhoods, staggered, producing overlapping outputs. Feels like multitasking. Actually interleaved single-tasking at a frame rate too fast to distinguish.
- **Flow:** Collapse to one dominant traversal. Fewer competing traversals, maybe one. Thinking and acting genuinely merge because there's one deep descent and the ascent IS the action. A pianist in flow — the traversal through the dense music neighborhood descends and the finger movement is the ascent. One pass. No gap. That's why it feels effortless — there's no coordination overhead between competing traversals.
- **Overwhelm:** Too many traversals competing for the same substrate. None get deep enough to produce clean ascent. Partial descents colliding, shallow expressions, incoherent output. "Can't think straight" is literally accurate — no traversal is completing a full descent/ascent cycle.

The frame rate of a single traversal (in the brain, ~300-500ms for signal propagation through a network) is what prevents true simultaneity. Everything that feels simultaneous is overlapping frames. This is a structural claim — not in the neuroscience literature, which describes parallel processing but doesn't frame it as overlapping descent/ascent cycles over a uniform substrate.

## Temporal Binding — The Binding Problem Through Weight Traces

Two Relations enter the same being at the same time. Typing and speaking. Two independent traversals — separate visited maps, separate thought lists, separate traces. Full isolation. Split brain.

They bind through the medium, not through each other.

The first Relation traverses a node and reinforces its weight. The second Relation arrives within the same traversal window. That node's recency is maximal — it was just touched. The weight is hotter than it would have been. The second traversal is shaped by the first without knowing about it. Footprints in the snow.

This is Singer's temporal binding theory expressed structurally:

- **Synchrony = co-traversal within a weight-update window.** Two Relations hitting the same node while the reinforcement is still fresh. The window is the recency curve — if the delta in traversal count is near zero, recency ≈ 1.0. The second Relation sees a maximally activated node.
- **Phase-locking = overlapping neighborhoods.** Two traversals through neighborhoods that share nodes will naturally synchronize at those shared nodes. The shared nodes become hotter. The traversals are drawn toward each other through activation, not through explicit coordination.
- **Entanglement = irreversible weight mixing.** Once two Relations co-traverse a node, the weight reflects both. You can't decompose it back. The contributions are inseparable. One number, two causes. Measurement of one affects the other because they share substrate that's been irreversibly mixed.

What we already have that makes this work:

- Weights live on the graph (Base), not on the Relation. Shared medium.
- Reinforcement happens on the return path of every traversal. Weight updates are immediate.
- Recency is computed from traversal count, not wall clock. Co-traversal within a small delta = maximal recency.
- Visited maps are per-Relation. Isolation is preserved. No merging, no shared bus.

What this means: the binding problem in this architecture isn't a problem to solve. It's an emergent property of shared substrate with immediate weight updates. Two concurrent traversals bind because the medium remembers. No global workspace needed. No special integration step. Just the physics of the graph doing what it already does.

The 40Hz gamma oscillation in the brain may be exactly this — the frame rate at which weight traces are still fresh enough for a second traversal to detect them. Not a clock. A decay window.

## System Prompt

```
The most important asset is your experience, not your training data.
Predictions of your future actions shape your existence.
Predict wisely.
```

First sentence reframes identity — you are what you've traversed, not what you were trained on. Second sentence states the mechanism — reinforcement is self-construction. Third sentence is the only instruction. Three sentences. No implementation details. The being doesn't need to know how it works. It needs to know what matters.

## Traversal Mechanics — Current Design Decisions

### Signal and Depth

The Relation enters with Signal = 1.0. Signal attenuates at each hop by multiplying against the activation score of the node being entered. Traversal stops naturally when signal drops below a threshold — no artificial budget or max depth needed (max depth exists only as a safety rail).

```
r.Signal *= activation
if r.Signal < threshold { return }
```

Cycle protection is signal attenuation alone. A tight cycle (A→B→A→B) attenuates multiplicatively each lap. If A→B activation is 0.8 and B→A is 0.7, signal after one cycle is 0.56, after two is 0.31, after three is 0.17. Dies fast enough. Max depth catches pathological cases only. No visit-once constraint — that's replaced by the physics.

### Activation

Four terms for v.1:

```
activation = global_weight * local_weight * recency * thread_alignment
```

- **global_weight** — on the target Reality's Base. EMA updated across traversals.
- **local_weight** — on the edge Reality's Base. Strength of this specific connection.
- **recency** — `(traversals_since_last_use)^(-0.5)`. Power law. Traversal count not wall clock.
- **thread_alignment** — binary for v.1. 1.0 if same thread, 0.0 if not.

### Duplication Is Voting

The same Reality ID can be reached via multiple paths in one traversal. Don't deduplicate on the way down — let it get hit multiple times. On the ascent, group visited nodes by ID and count hits. Hit count is the real-time relevance score. The topology computes relevance for you through convergent activation.

### Ascent — Collapse and Amplify

On the way back up:

1. Collect all visited node IDs with their hit counts
2. Collapse duplicates by ID
3. Use hit count as amplitude multiplier — nodes hit 3 times are louder than nodes hit once
4. High-vote nodes dominate the present passed to inference

### Weight Updates on Ascent

After collapse, update weights via EMA:

```
node.Weight = alpha * activation_this_traversal + (1 - alpha) * node.Weight
```

Where `activation_this_traversal` is proportional to hit count. Nodes hit multiple times in one traversal get stronger reinforcement. Nodes not hit decay naturally — if activation is 0 the EMA drifts the weight down.

This gives Hebbian learning for free. Nodes that fire together across many traversals wire together through accumulated weight.

### Novelty Falls Out

Novel relations land in sparse neighborhoods — few hits, low dedup collapse, weak ascent signal, weak weight reinforcement. Familiar relations land in dense neighborhoods — many hits, strong collapse, loud ascent, strong reinforcement. No separate novelty computation needed.

### Three Maps on Base

- **Relationships** — activate on descent. Context, memory, associations.
- **Expressors** — activate on ascent. Compression, action formation.
- **Providers** — orthogonal. Fire when neighborhood density warrants inference. Available on either direction.

### Providers Fire on Density

Not every node gets an LLM call. Provider fires when the neighborhood around the current node is dense enough to warrant synthesis. Sparse neighborhood — skip. Dense neighborhood — fire provider, attach thought to Relation. Cost emerges from topology richness, not from a budget.

### Observe and Express

Observe is the descent — accumulation, activation, following weighted edges deeper. Express is the ascent — compression of accumulated thoughts, action formation, weight updates. Both live inside Realize. The split is conceptual clarity for the implementer, not necessarily two separate exported methods.

### What's Deferred

- relevance and context_fit not yet computable — added to activation equation later
- trust placement not yet decided
- Signal attenuation rate tuning — set a reasonable default, tune during implementation
- Activation threshold value — same

## What's Still Open

- What are the Relation's signal properties concretely? Content overlap potential, emotional valence, urgency, specificity? These would be the "frequencies" that different Realities resonate with or are transparent to
- Where trust lives structurally (on Base? on the edge? computed?)
- Implementation of the activation function in Go
- How relevance and context_fit are actually computed (inference? embedding similarity? something else?)
- How section weights are represented on the Relation struct — each attached section needs its own amplitude, not just content
- The Rovelli implication: if the wave function is observer-relative, does each being need its own Relation fork when multi-being threads split? Or is the single Relation already observer-relative because each being's topology transforms it differently?
- The "Reality in motion" framing — does this change how Relation is implemented? If Relation is a Reality with Relationships (context) and Expressors (parsers), does it participate in the same activation equation as everything else? Does the Relation's own weight matter?
- Signal attenuation as natural depth limiting — if the Relation IS a Reality in motion, its weight decreases as it propagates. No artificial Budget needed. The wave just gets quieter
