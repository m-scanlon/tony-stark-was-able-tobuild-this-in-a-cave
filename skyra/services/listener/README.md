# Skyra Listener Service — Voice Shard Implementation

The listener is the always-on Voice Shard service. It handles voice capture, deterministic intent gating, triage, event delivery to the Brain Shard, and rendering Brain Shard-authored responses via TTS.

The Voice Shard is non-authoritative for semantic decisions. Every request goes to the Brain Shard.

**v1 behavior:** Voice Shard emits non-semantic ACKs only (earcon, LED, short wait phrase). Provisional responses — where the Voice Shard speaks a fast local answer before the Brain Shard responds — are deferred to v2. See G4 in `docs/arch/v1/gaps.md` and `docs/arch/v1/scyra.md` §7.1.

## Responsibilities

- Always-on audio pipeline: wake word → VAD → STT
- Deterministic intent gate (no LLM, no inference)
- Voice Shard triage: classify latency, delegation need, and provisional answer eligibility
- Front-door fast model: structure the event, generate provisional answer when eligible
- Durable local outbox for reliable event delivery to control plane
- Turn reconciliation: handle Brain Shard response and correct/confirm provisional if needed
- TTS output of Brain Shard-authored content

## Boundaries

Voice Shard is allowed to:
- Emit non-semantic ACKs (earcon, LED, short wait phrase)
- Render Brain Shard-authored `UPDATE | PLAN_PROGRESS | CLARIFY | PLAN_APPROVAL_REQUIRED | FINAL | ERROR`

> **v2:** Give a provisional answer from fresh LCACHE context, clearly qualified as non-authoritative, while Brain Shard processes in parallel.

Voice Shard must not:
- Generate semantic answers without fresh cached context
- Claim an action completed unless confirmed by Brain Shard
- Claim state changes occurred unless confirmed by Brain Shard
- Write or modify system memory or agent state

## 1. Audio Pipeline

```
wake word → VAD → STT → intent gate → triage → front-door model
```

**Wake word**: openWakeWord or Porcupine. Always-on, low power.

**VAD**: captures utterance boundaries. Avoids sending silence.

**STT**: Whisper small or base. Runs locally on Voice Shard. Optional: stream audio to Brain Shard for faster STT (see `docs/arch/v1/scyra.md` §7).

---

## 2. Intent Gate (Deterministic)

Runs before any LLM inference. Stateless and synchronous.

Rules (in order):
- No wake word detected → `ignore`
- Empty or filler transcript ("um", "uh", silence) → `ignore`
- Cancel intent detected ("never mind", "stop", "cancel") → `ignore`
- Otherwise → `dispatch`

No model involved. No ambiguity. Fast gate only.

---

## 3. Voice Shard Triage Layer

Runs after intent gate passes. Fast rules or tiny classifier. Produces routing and UX hints for the rest of the pipeline.

### Triage Output

```json
{
  "latency_class": "fast | medium | slow",
  "needs_delegation": true,
  "hint_target": "control_plane | shard:<id>",
  "ack_policy": "silent | nonverbal | spoken_if_slow",
  "confidence": 0.84,
  "provisional_eligible": true,
  "cache_age_seconds": 420
}
```

`provisional_eligible` — whether the front-door model is allowed to attempt a provisional answer. Set by triage based on intent type and cache freshness check (see Section 5).

`cache_age_seconds` — age of the most relevant item in LCACHE for this request, in seconds. Used by the front-door model to decide whether to answer provisionally.

Triage output is a hint, not final authority. Brain Shard makes all authoritative decisions.

---

## 4. Front-Door Fast Model

**Model**: Llama 3.2 3B Instruct (GGUF, Q4_K_M)
**Context target**: 4096–8192 tokens

Context budget (from Context Injector):
- 35% system instructions
- 25% live conversation
- 25% injected context package (LCACHE)
- 15% response/scratch headroom

Responsibilities:
- Structure the outgoing `voice_event_v1`
- If `provisional_eligible: true` — attempt a provisional answer from LCACHE
- Emit the appropriate user feedback ACK based on `ack_policy`

The front-door model runs event-driven — not always-on inference. It is invoked per utterance after the intent gate passes.

---

## 5. Provisional Response Model

> **v2 only — not implemented in v1.** Provisional responses are cut from v1 (see G4 in `docs/arch/v1/gaps.md`). This section documents the v2 design for reference.

The Voice Shard can give a provisional answer from cached context while the request is being processed authoritatively on Brain Shard. This reduces perceived latency for retrieval-style questions without breaking the authoritative model.

### When Voice Shard May Answer Provisionally

All conditions must be met:

| Condition | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Intent type | Read-only / retrieval only — "what did I decide", "what's the status of", "remind me" |
| Cache freshness | Most relevant LCACHE item `retrieved_at` within **30 minutes** |
| Confidence | Triage confidence above threshold (default: `0.75`) |
| Intent clarity | Unambiguous — no multi-step, no action words |
| LCACHE hit | At least one item with meaningful relevance score to the request |

### When Voice Shard Must Not Answer Provisionally

- Request implies action or state mutation ("turn off", "update", "delete", "create", "set")
- Cache is stale (`cache_age_seconds > 1800`) or empty
- Triage confidence below threshold
- Intent is ambiguous or multi-part
- `stale: true` on the current context package

### What Voice Shard Says

Voice Shard prefixes all provisional answers with a clear non-authoritative qualifier:

> "Based on what I have — [answer]. Let me confirm that for you."

The qualifier is not optional. Voice Shard must never state a provisional answer as fact.

### Provisional Answer Output (front-door model)

```json
{
  "provisional_answer": "Based on what I have — you decided on weekly Tekkit backups at 02:00 UTC last Tuesday. Let me confirm that for you.",
  "provisional_confidence": 0.81,
  "source_item_id": "mem_91",
  "cache_age_seconds": 420
}
```

If `provisional_eligible` is false or the front-door model cannot form a confident answer, `provisional_answer` is null and Voice Shard emits a non-semantic ACK only.

---

## 6. Event Schema

### voice_event_v1

v1 event — no provisional fields. `context_window` and `context_state` are v2 additions (see CHANGELOG.md).

```json
{
  "schema": "voice_event_v1",
  "turn_id": "turn_8f4c",
  "ts": "2026-02-20T18:10:12Z",
  "device_id": "voice-shard-livingroom",
  "transcript": "what did I decide about the Tekkit backups",
  "triage_hints": {
    "latency_class": "medium",
    "needs_delegation": true,
    "hint_target": "control_plane",
    "ack_policy": "spoken_if_slow",
    "confidence": 0.84
  },
  "session_state": {
    "pending_job_id": null,
    "waiting_for": null
  }
}
```

> **v2 additions:** `voice_shard_gave_provisional`, `provisional_text`, `context_window`, `context_state` — see CHANGELOG.md.

`context_state` is included on every request. Voice Shard computes `available_for_injection` as `total_context_tokens - system_tokens - live_conversation_tokens - response_reserve_tokens`. Brain Shard fans this out internally to the Context Injector, which uses it to size the next context package. Voice Shard does not interface with the Context Injector directly — it only speaks to the Brain Shard API Gateway.

---

## 7. Outbox and Event Delivery

Voice Shard uses a local SQLite outbox for durable event delivery.

```
1. Front-door produces voice_event_v1
2. Voice Shard writes event to local outbox (before sending)
3. Voice Shard sends event to Brain Shard API Gateway
4. Brain Shard writes to inbox (event_id PRIMARY KEY — idempotent)
5. Brain Shard sends transport ACK
6. Voice Shard deletes outbox row on ACK match
```

If no ACK arrives within timeout, Voice Shard retries from outbox. Events are delivered at-least-once. Brain Shard inbox deduplicates by `event_id`.

Transport ACK is machine-to-machine only. It is never spoken to the user.

Reference: `docs/arch/v1/event-ingress-ack.md`

---

## 8. Turn Loop and Reconciliation

### State Machine

```
IDLE → LISTENING → TRANSCRIBED → FORWARDED → ACKED → RUNNING → RESOLVED
```

- `RUNNING → RUNNING` on `UPDATE` or `PLAN_PROGRESS`
- `RUNNING → LISTENING` on `CLARIFY`
- `RUNNING → RESOLVED` on `FINAL | ERROR`

### Reconciliation Protocol

**v1 behavior:** Voice Shard renders Brain Shard-authored messages directly via TTS. No provisional to reconcile against.

> **v2:** When Brain Shard responds with `FINAL`, Voice Shard reconciles against any provisional answer it gave:

| Brain Shard result | Voice Shard behavior |
|---|---|
| Brain Shard agrees with provisional | Silent, or soft "confirmed" — do not repeat the answer |
| Brain Shard has additional detail | Speak the delta: "Also worth noting — [Brain Shard addition]" |
| Brain Shard contradicts provisional | Correct clearly: "Update — [Brain Shard answer]" |

Voice Shard appends the authoritative Brain Shard content to the local context window on `FINAL | ERROR` and closes the turn.

### Voice Shard Turn Loop (Pseudocode)

```python
def on_user_utterance(audio_chunk_stream):
    turn_id = new_turn_id()
    transcript = stt(audio_chunk_stream)
    triage = pi_fast_triage(transcript)
    context_window = context_manager.snapshot_for_turn(turn_id)

    provisional = None
    # v2 only — provisional responses deferred to v2
    # if triage["provisional_eligible"]:
    #     provisional = front_door_model.attempt_provisional(transcript, lcache)
    #     if provisional:
    #         tts_speak(provisional["provisional_answer"])

    event = build_voice_event_v1(
        turn_id=turn_id,
        transcript=transcript,
        triage=triage,
        provisional=provisional,
        context_window=context_window,
    )

    outbox.persist(event)
    if not provisional:
        emit_user_ack(triage["ack_policy"])
    transport.send(event)

    while True:
        msg = transport.recv_for_turn(turn_id, timeout=TURN_TIMEOUT_S)
        if msg is None:
            transport.retry_from_outbox(event["event_id"])
            continue

        if msg["message_type"] in ("UPDATE", "PLAN_PROGRESS"):
            maybe_speak_progress(msg["text"], triage["ack_policy"])
            continue

        if msg["message_type"] == "CLARIFY":
            tts_speak(msg["text"])
            context_manager.append_assistant(turn_id, msg["text"], authoritative=True)
            return "needs_user_input"

        if msg["message_type"] == "PLAN_APPROVAL_REQUIRED":
            tts_speak(msg["text"])
            context_manager.append_assistant(turn_id, msg["text"], authoritative=True)
            return "awaiting_plan_approval"

        if msg["message_type"] in ("FINAL", "ERROR"):
            reconciled = reconcile(provisional, msg["text"])
            tts_speak(reconciled)
            context_manager.append_assistant(turn_id, msg["text"], authoritative=True)
            outbox.delete_if_acked(event["event_id"])
            return "resolved"
```

---

## 9. LCACHE (Listener Context Cache)

LCACHE is the Voice Shard-side context store fed by the Context Injector service on Brain Shard. It holds compressed, ranked context packages ready for front-door model use.

### Freshness Check for Provisional Answers

> **v2 only — not implemented in v1.** LCACHE freshness checking for provisional eligibility is part of the v2 provisional response model.

Each item in a context package carries a `retrieved_at` timestamp. Before giving a provisional answer, the front-door model checks the most relevant item's `retrieved_at` against the 30-minute threshold:

```python
PROVISIONAL_MAX_AGE_SECONDS = 1800  # 30 minutes, configurable

def is_fresh_enough_for_provisional(item):
    age = now() - parse_iso(item["retrieved_at"])
    return age.total_seconds() < PROVISIONAL_MAX_AGE_SECONDS
```

If no relevant item meets the freshness threshold, `provisional_eligible` is set to false by triage and no provisional answer is attempted.

### Cache Failure Behavior

- Context Injector unavailable → keep last package until TTL grace expires, then run on base + live context only
- Stale package (`stale: true`) → do not attempt provisional answers, emit non-semantic ACK only

---

## 10. Recommended Front-Door Model

- `Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct` (GGUF, `Q4_K_M` preferred)
- Context target: `4096` to `8192` tokens
- Keep long memory retrieval and heavy context assembly in the control plane

Context compression reference: `skyra/internal/context/compress`

---

## 11. v2 Planned Upgrade — Reactive Layer

A two-tier model stack is planned for v2 to make interactions feel more natural. The gap between utterance end and first response is where the robotic feeling comes from.

- **Tier 1 (reactive)** — rule-based phrase pool, fires ~100ms after utterance ends. Maps triage output to natural acknowledgements ("on it", "let me check", "mhm"). No model, no latency.
- **Tier 2 (front-door)** — existing 3B model, unchanged. Provisional answers and event structuring follow after.

This is a drop-in addition before the front-door model invocation. Nothing in the core architecture changes. Deferred until v1 is stable.
